# MIPS_CPU
Year 2 Instruction Architecture Projects
- A full MIPS-compatible CPU implemented in Verilog, including the ALU, Register File, and BUS modules. 
- The CPU can implement the full 48 ISA instructions and store and read external RAM with an increasingly difficult test testbench, as well as a customer-oriented report.
